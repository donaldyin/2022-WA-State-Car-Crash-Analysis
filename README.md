# 2022-WA-State-Car-Crash-Analysis
This repo contains all the files that constitutes my final project for ECON 481.
main.py is the final script for all the code combined to run the statistical analysis.

It extracts, transforms, and loads in the data and then runs multiple models to generate statistical plots.
